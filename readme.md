Answer the following questions clearly:
1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
2.How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
3.What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
4.What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

Answer---->

1===> ***getElementById-->Using this we can use the data written on HTML by inputting the specific ID name ***getElementsByClassName-->Using this we can use the data of classname given on HTML ***querySelector / querySelectorAll-->By using querySelector we can find any id or class... here querySelector will show the very first item only if input it by a classname and querySelectorAll will show the all elements used by same classname.

2==> first const div = document.createElement (tag name whatever you want to create and remember the element/ tag name always inside quotation) ("div") and insert this element parent container.appendChild(the created tag/element name)


3==> Event Bubbling is process of climbing codes from initial item to it's parentNode by parentNode step by step to the final parentNode..when we click on a button it will bubble to it's parentNode to the final parentNode and show all outputs that we have coded.

4==> By Event Delegation we can handle same type buttons or items click-handler in a single eventListener by using parentNode and children to get the desired items..It is very useful in a project which consists lots of buttons or events...It also reduces code for same type events by gathering all items in a single function.

5==> ***preventDefault()-->It generally prevents the page from reloading after submitting any form. ***stopPropagation()-->It stops the process of any event-bubbling to it's final parentNode. Difference--->
preventDefault()
-->Stops browser from it's default reloading system
-->Can be used to control behavior of a targeted element of code
stopPropagation() -->Stops the propagation to the final parentNode -->Can be used to control event propagation
